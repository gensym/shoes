    Hi, guys, thankyou for taking Shoes.

    Shoes is for writing plain old windowing software.  But it borrows a
    few things I like from the web:

    * Hyperlinks and URLs within Shoes and to the web.
    * Simple text layout -- though Shoes eschews floats.
    * Images and colors in the layout and in the background.
    * Margin and padding.
    * Resizable layouts.

    However, layouts can be tough on the web.  Like a two-column layout.
    So rather than using floating divs, Shoes uses two layout types:
    stacks and flows.  More on that later.

    Shoes does keep a few things from traditional windowing toolkits:

    * Buttons.
    * Text edit (single-line and multi-line).
    * Progress bars.
    * Scroll bars.
    * Dialogs.

    And, last of all, Shoes gets some inspiration from NodeBox and
    Processing:

    * The whole window is a canvas.
    * Shapes, paths, curves and transformations.
    * Animation.
    * Easy event-handling for mouse and keyboard.

    Lastly, Shoes uses Ruby as its interface language.

    That's really about all that's in Shoes.  It's supposed to be light.
    Not much code and not too much ambition.

    WHY NOT WXWINDOWS?  WHY NOT THE FOX TOOLKIT?  OR QT??

    Shoes is strictly inspired by stuff like REBOL/View, HyperCard,
    the web itself and, of course, Processing and NodeBox.

    I don't like the bulkiness and the layers and layers of wxWindows,
    FOX, QT, GNOME.  They are big, big libraries and all the apps look
    identical, devoid of spirit.

    The unique thing about the web is that it gives you very few
    controls, but people are able to build wildly different pages
    with it that are still immediately accessible to people.

    THE INSIDE OF SHOES

    So, to save a bit of work, Shoes relies on a few libraries:

    * Cairo, for drawing. (http://cairographics.org)
    * Pango, for text.
    * Ruby, for programming.

    All native widgets use the OS APIs directly.  Half of Shoes is platform
    specific code.  The targets are: OSX, Windows and GTK.

    BUILDING AND INSTALLING SHOES

    Since this project is in its infancy, be sure to get instructions from
    the wiki at http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/shoes/.  Things are changing
    quickly and this README will be updated when the first release is made.
