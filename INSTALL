This is a source distribution for compiling Shoes on Linux,
FreeBSD and other similar architectures.  Be sure you have
make, gcc, cairo, pango and ruby present.

Then run:

  make

Which will build Shoes and place it in the `dist/` folder.
You may run examples from there:

  cd dist
  ./shoes samples/timer.rb

If you'd like to install Shoes, you can optionally run
make install.  The Makefile also respects the PREFIX 
environment variable.

  make PREFIX=/opt/shoes install

To compile video support, install VLC and its development
libraries.  Then run:

  make VIDEO=1

This process has largely been tested on Debian distros,
so please head over to the Shoes wiki or the mailing list
if you have some issues and need a hand or have some
advice.
